# FPGA-Based-Audio-Equalizer
This project implements a 3-band audio equalizer on an FPGA, designed using IIR and FIR filters to manipulate different frequency ranges of an audio signal in real time. The goal is to filter and adjust the gain of low (bass), mid, and high (treble) frequency bands to enhance sound quality according to user preferences.
